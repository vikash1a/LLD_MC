PS 
     Design rate limiter â€” A rate limiter is a tool that monitors the number of requests per a window time a service agrees to allow. If the request count exceeds the number agreed by the service owner and the user (in a decided window time), the rate limiter blocks all the excess calls(say by throwing exceptions). The user can be a human or any other service(ex: in a micro service based architecture

Approach 
    token bucket
        assign fixed no of token per unit time for each user
        subtract token each time request id hit
        if no token is left then reject request

    fixed counter
        maintain count of request per unit time per user

    sliding logs
        maintain sliding window history of logs per unit time per user

    sliding window  
        maintain sliding counter with timestamp per user
        
design
    Dict<id,LinkedList<timestamp>>
