Approach 
    token bucket
        assign fixed no of token per unit time for each user
        subtract token each time request id hit
        if no token is left then reject request

    fixed counter
        maintain count of request per unit time per user

    sliding logs
        maintain sliding window history of logs per unit time per user

    sliding window  
        maintain sliding counter with timestamp per user
