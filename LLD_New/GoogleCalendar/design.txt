Design a calendar Application (similar on lines with Google's Calendar)
It should support the following functionalities:
    Ability to create, update, delete an Event
        a. An event would typically consist of {start, end, location, Owner, user-list, title}.
        b. Events can either be like meetings(with a dedicated location and appropriate guest-list)
         or as well be like holidays, birthdays, reminders etc.
        c. An event once created, can be either accepted or rejected by the constituent users -
         if neither it should be in neutral state.
    Get Calendar for a user Ui
    Get Event details.
    For a given set of users[U1, U2,....Un] identity a common free slot of time.
